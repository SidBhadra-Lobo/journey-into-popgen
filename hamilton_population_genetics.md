## Chapter 1

- **expectations** can be defined as the expected value of a random variable (especially the average)
- popgen consists of constructing and testing expectations for genetic variation in populations of individual organisms.
- first principles: Mendelian inheritance, mutation, mating patterns, gene flow, and natural selection
    - need to keep these in mind at all times
- **parameters** are idealized quantities. They are assumed to have exact values.
    - idealized means messy real-life details of how to measure quantities are ignored
- **parameter estimates** are given by sampling a population and measuring the parameter you're interested in.
    - in all populations, a parameter will have **one** true value. In order to get that value, you need to measure every individual. Therefore, in the interest of getting things done, we use parameter estimates.

- What good is a theory if it is based on so many assumptions?
    - a theory can elucidate assumptions and generate testable predictions. These predictions can be found false and eliminated. 
    - Reducing the complexity of a population is useful to determine the variables that influence a population parameter.
